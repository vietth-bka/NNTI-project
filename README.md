# NNTI Project WS 2024/2025

## About

See [tasks](./tasks) to get started.

# Notes

## Code Submission

You don't necessarily need to complete the code in this Jupyter Notebook, you are free to use another notebook or a python script file, as you would like. You are expected to submit the code by **10.03.2025**.

Your code should be clean and well commented. We also expect that if we decide to run it on our system, it should be straighforward to do so. We recommend creating a ```requirements.txt``` file with the names of all the libraries with their versions. If applicable, please mention the python version in a ```README.md``` file, which should also include instructions on how to run your code.

As mentioned for the assignments, **always remember to cite the code with the links as comments, if you decide to use it from a public repository**.

## Report Submission

With the code, you are also expected to submit a report with a maximum of 4 pages. You should write your report in LaTeX using this template for ACL 2023 [Overleaf Link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2023-proceedings-template/qjdgcrdwcnwp). Use this document to fill in any missing information that are not necessarily covered during your presentation for the sake of time in the presentation. While writing your report, we would highly encourgae you to cite the papers behind each tool / library / function that you might use for your experiments. Here is the documention on how to write equations in LaTeX [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions).

You are also expected to **submit this report with your code**. You should provide the **.tex, .pdf and all image files** zipped with the same naming convention as it was in your assignments.

## Presentation

From **17.03** to **21.03**, each team will present their work for 15 minutes. We expect equal contribution from each member in delivery and content of the presentation. So roughly 5 minutes for one person if you have 3 people in your team. There will be 5 minutes for Q&A. At-least one person from your team should be present to do an in-person presentation, rest of your team could join remotely if they are not present.

## Important Dates

 - Code & Report Submission: **10.03.2025 (23:59)**
 - Presentations: **17.03.2025 to 21.03.2025**
 
 You'll get a precise date and time for your team's presentation at a later time.

### Grading

In this project, your final grades will be determined as follows:

 - **30%**: &emsp; Completing all the tasks
 - **30%**: &emsp; Provide comprehensive analyses and justifications for all decisions, supported by robust scientific evidence, including relevant experiments and/or citations from scholarly papers.
 - **20%**: &emsp; Quality of the content of the presentation
 - **20%**: &emsp; Delivery of the presentation
